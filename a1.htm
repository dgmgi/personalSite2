I have been practicing Pixel Art recently and what I see that is most recommended is Aseprite. It’s a pixel art editing tool. It’s very accessible as a beginner because it doesn’t bombard you with stuff when you open it. The screen actually looks like a pixel game when you open it. It runs smoothly even on low end PCs. Once you get used to making pixel art, animating frames is also easy as it provides you with useful display on how to edit each frame. 
<br><br>

<div class= "ase1">
<img src= "img/ase1.png" border= "2">
</div>
<br><br>
<font face= "Raleway" color= "black" size= 5>
This is what you can see on the upper right of the screen. It’s easy creating and opening existing files. There’s also a “Recover Files” option. This option allows users to recover files they haven’t saved yet. There’s also a “recent files” pane where it shows your most recent files that you have made/opened. This makes it very easy for you to check your previous work, or continue working on your project that you haven’t finished yet.

<div class= "ase2">
<img src= "img/ase2.png" border= "2">
</div>
<br><br>
<font face= "Raleway" color= "black" size= 5>
Upon clicking “New File”, this modal appears. The layout of it is simple and easy to use. Using Aseprite a few times, you’ll already get used to making new files. You get to choose the size of your canvas, and the type of background.
<br><br>
When using Aseprite for the first time, another modal will pop, telling you not to worry, as the canvas and sprite size can still be changed later on.
<br><br>
The interface is really user friendly because in my opinion, everything looks ‘’gamified”, unlike other photo editing tools such as Photoshop or other Adobe apps.

<div class= "ase2">
<img src= "img/ase3.png" border= "2">
</div>
<br><br>
<font face= "Raleway" color= "black" size= 5>
This is the first thing you see when you click “OK” when creating a new sprite. There’s the canvas, the colors on the upper left, the color wheel on the lower left, and the tools on the upper right.
<br><br>
There are colors readily available, and if you can’t see the one you like, there’s the color wheel. Not only do you get to pick the color you want, you can also edit it’s hie, vibrance, and saturation there. 
<br><br>
The upper right shows the tools. When hovering on a tool with your cursor, a box pops up telling you what tool that is, it’s shortcut, and what it does. 
<br><br>
This is one of my favorite functions in Aseprite. When you click on the pencil tool, this will show on the upper left of the screen. With this, you can edit the pixel size and shape. The two icons on the right-most part is mirror mode, where when you paint on one side, the other side will be painted on the exact place. Finally, there’s a check box for “Pixel - perfect”. This I by far the most useful function. When making pixel art, there’s a common mistake people do which is called “jaggies”. When “Pixel - perfect” is checked, Aseprite automatically adjusts the pencil tool so that you can’t create “jaggies”.

This is one of my finished works in Aseprite. Exporting it can be very easy. Upon clicking the “File” tab on the uppermost left, this will pop up (Left image), and when you click on the export tab, this will pop up (Right image).

<br><br>
<div class= "ase2">
<img src= "img/ase5.png" border= "2">
</div>
<br><br>
<font face= "Raleway" color= "black" size= 5>
As you can see, even on the export part, you can still edit what shows on the final output. There’s the “Export for Twitter” option which I often use because I post most of my works there. Clicking export will export your final output in your designated location.
<br><br>
Overall, Aseprite is really Pixel Art Beginner friendly. Not only did I learn how to make pixel art, it was also fun for me because of it’s “gamified” interface, and it’s easiness to use.
