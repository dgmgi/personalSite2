The past meetings have been very hard in my perspective, aside from family problems
and the pandemic, I don’t have proper time management when it comes to my task. I usually
just sleep things off when I feel even just a little bit tired.<br><br>
Having groupmates really helps to boost morale though. Our group is pretty chill to
begin with and we get along with each other well. Everyone respects every idea put on the
table. One problem we found is communication. One of my groupmates is retaking a subject
so he is more overloaded than me and the other guy. When we all do manage to be online at
the same time, we easily get work done.<br><br>
What I loved about our discussion is we talked about games we all played, and in doing
so, we all found a common problem in it. We decided to base our presentation around the
problems of Team Fight Tactics. Since we all played the game, we can immediately relate with
each other on each input we give. Unsurprisingly, we all have the same problems with it,
whether it be the memorization part, the inconvenience of the in game cheat sheet, or the fact
that luck plays a part on whether you win or not.<br><br>
After deciding on the problem, we empathized and asked our other friends who play
the game, on what problems they think are evident in the game. We were nervous about the
presentation though, as we saw all of the other groups didn’t go to solve for a game. The
anxiety about our presentation was gone though, after presenting it to Ms. Jen as we only
needed to tweak some quotes and add more pain points and we can then proceed to
storyboarding.<br><br>
The main problem we are all facing now is that the laptop of the one who is tasked to
draw for the storyboard broke down as it was accidentally rained on.
