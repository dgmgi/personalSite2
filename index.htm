				Hi! My name is Dave Angel but you can call me Dave.<br><br>
				I love to stay indoors and occasionally go out with friends. I love to play games, especially fighting games like Tekken and Marvel vs Capcom. I also love to read manga, watch anime, and practice guitar to play anime OSTs.<br><br>
				I'm afraid of needles, especially when I'm going to have my blood extracted, or have a shot. I usually get very sad, scared, and occasionally, cry before I get a needle in me.<br><br>
				The most memorable moment for me was when I joined an official Tekken Tournament where I met professional players which are also my idols as they kept the community alive since before I was born. I didn't go last long in the tournament, but it was a fun experience. Just like them, I want to make a significant mark on the community.
				I'm afraid of what will happen to me career-wise. The pandemic has changed how I look at the future, but I'm still hoping that everything will all be good in the end.
