			Design Thinking at the start is all about finding the problem and closing down on it,
which is what I’m not used to. Usually when I’m in a group, they always immediately try to find
a solution, and this is what I did to for a very long time. Then came the Design Process.<br> <br>
I find the Design Process a bit hard to understand. There are three “phases”, Assessing,
Designing, and Building. Assessing is where you “Understand the Problem” and “Generate
Possible Solutions”. What I found confusing is that, why would you generate possible solutions
in the Assessing phase. I asked myself, “Shouldn’t that be in the Design Phase?”.<br> <br>
Design Phase is Analyzing and Selecting from a list of proposed solutions. What I find
hard to understand here is if you are going to do some prototyping, or just select a solution,
plain and simple.
This is when I started understanding a little bit as to why but can’t seem to put it into
words. The way I see it, Assessing is some sort of Ideation, while in Designing Phase, you finalize
the proposed solution after assessment. Finally, we have to Build the project. I think this is the
true prototyping phase.<br> <br>
What I like about the Design Thinking Process is you don’t go in a problem blindly.
From the start, you assess many things that can really help you in formulating a possible
solution such as knowing your target audience and putting yourself in their shoes, and see how
it affects them.
