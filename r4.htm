To be honest, I did not understand much about this lesson as the day this was discussed,
our internet connection was very clunky. What I took away from the discussion in general
though is, how information should be organized and accessed, and how it should be
presented.<br> <br>
There are different ways as to how you can do this, but it is very important for users to
understand what they’re looking at or how they will look for it. Reading the slides, I liked
navigation the most as it can help me on creating my own website. A website should show
where you are, what’s on other pages, where a user can go, and where a user has been. This
is a hierarchy itself, formed by a user. A user navigates and therefore, will know what to expect
when going further, or going back in a site.<br> <br>
Having structured data will not only help the users, but also the developers in the long
run. What I mean by this is that, whenever I need to edit something like add or delete
something in the site, I can easily search for it, not just in the back-end of things, but also in
the front end, as the interface I made from the very beginning, since organized, is easy to
traverse through. I can look for the problem easily as a “user”.<br> <br>
