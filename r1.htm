			It’s really hard to learn in an Online Class environment, but in this first few weeks, I can
tell that all of us are trying to help each other to make the most of it. Not gonna lie, I’m still
having troubles. Even if I’m a visual learner, it’s still hard because of distractions from outside
the call, and slow internet.<br><br>
What I like doing that we’re doing now is the Kahoot. It’s a good warm up to put me in
a “learning mood”. It kind of emphasizes that it’s time for school.
The weekly asynchronous learning is still kind of awkward for me. I understand it’s to
make the most of your time like you’re still waking up early to go to school, but to be in the
comfort of your own home, it makes it really difficult. We have also have been handling health
issues as most of my family members tested positive for the virus. Thankfully though, they’re
all okay and recovering now. Maybe this week, it’ll be easier for me to pay attention now.
The topic this week is still new to me. I’m not a very creative person to begin with, so
seeing that I need to balance aesthetics and coding is hard for me. My coding itself is very
messy. It’s nice to have activities to warm up our HTML and CSS skills.<br><br>
As I said earlier, the Kahoot quizzes really help to keep me to focus in classes. The pace
of the classes are just right for me. I think I will have troubles with User Design as , historically,
it’s hard for me to make something that is well received by clients. It’s hard for me to visualize
what they want. The persona activity really helped me fix this issue though.
Having personas can help visualize what the product will be. Them being fictional but
realistic really helps. The pressure from creating something the “client” wants is not that much.
