Before starting the lesson, we were tasked to create an invitation for an after-dinner
party for what I assumed was a happening after a wedding. I have attended many weddings
and took inspiration from the invitations I remember. I usually see simple invitations with clear
information as to where and when the event will happen.
<br><br>
I focused on the aesthetic when I made the invitation, especially with the design and
font I used. I believe I did a decent job making the invitation, especially while the lesson for
Visual and Information design was ongoing.
<br><br>
I do agree that spacing between letters and words are important to make your visuals
clear. Contrast is also important as how I see it; contrast is one of the things that will direct the
reader’s eyes as to what and where they should put in their attention first.
<br><br>
Reading the three goals of visual design, I do agree with all of these. What I was most
interested in though was PACE. Having proper pacing to guide your viewers and not get them
lost, and at the same time, build up their anticipation on what is next to come is personally
hard for me to do. That, and organizing information as so what the readers will read will make
sense in hard.
<br><br>
The next part of Visual and Information Design are the basic tools, which are:
Typography, Layout, and Color. I’m not the best at selecting or making proper typography in
the first place as I usually select a font that makes it easy to read for myself, not for my intended
target audience which is a problem. 
<br><br>
I do agree that some typefaces makes something very iconic, and when that was
mentioned, I thought about it a lot, like how I know someone’s work in an essay is his/hers
because of the font they used, or how I know a game is Metal Gear when I see the subtitle
font. The font of Metal Gear really strikes me as interesting as it makes you feel like it’s a font
the military uses which makes it look like everything said is very important.
<br><br>
Layout is also important as, the content isn’t the only thing that will help a reader
understand what they are reading, remembering that pace is also a goal, readers should know
how to traverse when reading, keeping their reading to a steady pace. It should not be hard
for readers to see where the next words should be, where they should look at next, or what
they should click to traverse through a site.
<br><br>
Finally, we have colors, which I have a problem too as well. I decide what color I should
use without considering who will read it. I usually pick a color easy for me to read, or colors I
think are pleasant for me without considering the theme needed.
